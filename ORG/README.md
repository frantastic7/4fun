# Desktop organisation script

written in python, usable from terminal with shell script

open "run_org.sh" with "vim run_org.sh"  
 
depending on the shell you have use either /bin/bash or the zsh line (delete the other)  

replace the path_to_script with the location of org.py on your machine  

use "chmod +x run_org.sh" to make it executable  

then use "sudo mv run_org.sh /usr/local/bin/org"  

now call it anytime by typing "org" into your terminal  
  
  
if you use windows use the "run_org.bat"  
simply replace the "path_to" with the complete path to the python script (use the copy path in windows explorer)  

now you can use the script by running the .bat file
